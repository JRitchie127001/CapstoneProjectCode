Code from the completed projects from the Learning C++ and SDL2 course from https://www.studyplan.dev/sdl2 as well as an independent implementation of Mastermind based on the work done in the course.

To run a project has simply run the .exe in the x64/release folder. Keep any assets (.png, .ttf, etc.) in the same folder as the exe.
